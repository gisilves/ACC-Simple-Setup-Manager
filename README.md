# ACC-Setup-Manager
Simple setup manager for Assetto Corsa Competizione

1. Select a car and a track then either
  a. Load local setups and check them by double clicking
  b. Load an external setup file and automatically copy it in the right directory
 
That's it (for now).

Fell free to suggest additions and bugfixes.
